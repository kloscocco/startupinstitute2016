		<p>My name is Kamala Loscocco and I am a Web Design student in the Startup Institute's summer cohort. I am looking forward to learning UI and UX and getting in to an exciting and challenging career path! I live in Cambridge, MA with one roommate and one hairy cat. I enjoy travelling, cooking, and rock climbing, in my spare time.</p>
